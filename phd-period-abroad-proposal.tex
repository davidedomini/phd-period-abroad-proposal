\section{Proposal}\label{sec:intro}

\paragraph{Context.}
Computing devices have become ubiquitous in everyday life.
%
This trend has paved the way for research fields aimed at exploiting
 the potential of device collectives to build next-generation systems, 
 including: collective computing~\cite{DBLP:journals/computer/Abowd16}
 and Collective Adaptive Systems (CAS)~\cite{DBLP:journals/sttt/WirsingJN23,robyphdthesis}.
%
More in detail, following Mitchell's definition~\cite{DBLP:conf/metacognition/Mitchell05}, 
 in this thesis we refer to CAS as distributed systems comprising multiple agents 
 such that each agent:
 \begin{enumerate*}[label=(\roman*)]
	\item can interact with other agents either directly or indirectly;
	\item does not individually posses system-wide knowledge;
	\item can exhibit learning to expand its personal knowledge; and
	\item can make decisions based on collective or aggregated knowledge from some of its peers.
 \end{enumerate*}
%
Notably, we focus on systems involving a large number of agents -- potentially in the hundreds
 or thousands -- which is commonly referred to in the literature 
 as many-agents~\cite{DBLP:phd/ethos/Yang21a}.

\paragraph{Opportunities and challenges.}
These systems enable the development of innovative applications in a wide range of real-world domains, such as: 
 smart cities~\cite{DBLP:conf/icse/IftikharRBW017}, 
 traffic control~\cite{DBLP:journals/tits/ChuWCL20,DBLP:books/sp/Muller2011/ProthmannTBHMS11} 
 with autonomous vehicles~\cite{DBLP:journals/corr/BojarskiTDFFGJM16}, 
 coordinated robot swarms for search and rescue~\cite{DBLP:journals/ijon/ZhouLLXS21} 
 or environmental monitoring~\cite{DBLP:conf/acsos/AguzziVE23}, and many more.
%
Nevertheless, while these systems have significant potential, their engineering 
 presents several challenges.
%
First and foremost, control and decision-making demand particular attention.
%
Achieving an optimal balance between centralized and decentralized control is crucial, 
 as neither extreme is feasible nor desirable~\cite{DBLP:conf/coordination/CasadeiPVN19,DBLP:journals/tits/ChuWCL20,DBLP:journals/jair/LyuBXDA23} 
 in many dynamic systems. 
% 
Indeed, excessive centralization may lead to bottlenecks and single points of failure, 
 whereas complete decentralization can hinder coordination and consistency.
%
Additionally, the dynamic nature of these systems, characterized by constant 
 environmental changes, mobility, and potential component failures, requires adaptive 
 learning mechanisms capable of responding swiftly 
 to evolving conditions~\cite{DBLP:journals/swarm/PrasetyoMF19}.
%
Another key consideration is the locality principle, where operational efficiency and cost 
 are heavily influenced by the spatial proximity of data sources, processing units, and users.
%
Furthermore, partial observability introduces uncertainty, as individual components may have 
 limited or incomplete information about the global state, complicating accurate 
 decision-making~\cite{DBLP:conf/uai/HeDB22}.

\paragraph{Research Gap.}
Despite significant progress in the field of cooperative learning within CAS, 
 several challenges remain open, indicating substantial research gaps.
%
First, achieving large-scale cooperative learning continues to be challenging, from both technological 
 and methodological perspectives. 
% 
Technologically, simulating these systems is highly resource-intensive, requiring significant 
 computational power and time. 
% 
This necessitates the development of more efficient tools and advanced learning pipelines to enhance 
 scalability and reduce resource consumption.
%
Methodologically, learning in environments with a high number of agents is often unstable and challenging to manage. 
%
Centralized learning architectures are frequently impractical, primarily due to privacy concerns or technical 
 constraints related to communication and synchronization overheads. 
% 
Although decentralized approaches have been proposed as a viable alternative, they typically lead to 
 suboptimal performance when compared to centralized counterparts, largely due to difficulties in maintaining global 
 coordination and consistency.
%
Another critical challenge arises from the heterogeneous data distribution among agents.
% 
This heterogeneity is frequently influenced by the spatial distribution of the agents.
%
This builds on the assumption that devices in spatial proximity have similar experiences and make similar 
 observations~\cite{esterle2022deep}, as
 the phenomena to capture is intrinsically context dependent.

\paragraph{Research plan.}
This research is expected to involve:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Investigation of scalable transfer learning mechanisms for decentralized learning in many-agent systems;
	\item Investigation of macroprogramming coordination strategies -- such as dynamic leader election -- for enhancing 
	 transfer learning in decentralized many-agent scenarios, particularly where spatial proximity influences 
	 data distribution and learning dynamics;
	\item Integration of the above into simulated environments and evaluation on representative case studies 
	 (e.g., traffic control, robotic coordination).
\end{itemize}
